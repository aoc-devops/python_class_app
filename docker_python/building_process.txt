To understand how this build job works:
1. While creating codebuild app, we have to provide only one environment veriable that is DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME. This environment variable is for our undrstading to identify our
build image with same name in ecr repo
2. This is for tagging the build image and tagging the reop as well. DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME COULD be anything for our understanding.
3. This environment is also applicable to build_and_push.sh script because we are runnig script on codebuil server as well.
4. Buildspec.yml have one command printenv, this prints environment variables at buildserver (These are inbuilt environment varivables) eg, 
ODEBUILD_SOURCE_REPO_URL   //https://github.com/aoc-devops/python_class_app.git
BRANCH_NAME
CODEBUILD_SOURCE_VERSION
CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR   // is root level directory of repo // /codebuild/output/src4124379041/src/github.com/aoc-devops/python_class_app
$CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR/docker_python/scripts/build_and_push.sh $DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME    // we are finding script in this manner
5. Buildspec.yml invokes build_and_push.sh script to build and push image to ecr, but to install some depandancies and make customization in base image we need dockerfile
6. The above mentioned script runs docker build command ot build image from Dockerfile and push that image to ecr repo.
